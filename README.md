This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a housing price data that is accessible on Kaggle. Some of the features in the dataset include the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, year built, neighborhood and price of the house.

The aim of the analysis would be to get to know the connections between the different features and the target variable which in this case is the price. This involves visualization of distributions, detection of trends and confirmation of relationships amongst features.

Data was loaded with the help of pandas and visualizations were done in seaborn and matplotlib. Scatter plots, box plots and a correlation heatmap were used to derive key observations. The analysis will concentrate on the way every numeric and categorical variable can affect the end price of a house.

The content of this notebook is aimed at students or other beginners who would like to train their skills of data analysis on a real-world dataset. It can be used as a basis of subsequent feature engineering or model construction of the predictive problem like house price prediction.

To execute the notebook, obtain the required libraries as identified in requirements.txt file and open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any python environment that supports the notebook.
